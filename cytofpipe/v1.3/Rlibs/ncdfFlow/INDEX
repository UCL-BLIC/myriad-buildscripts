[[,ncdfFlowSet,ANY-method

as.flowSet              convert from a 'ncdfFlowSet' to a 'flowSet'
clone.ncdfFlowSet       Clone a ncdfFlowSet
densityplot,formula,ncdfFlowSet-method
                        flowViz plot methods.
filter,ncdfFlowList,filter-method
                        Accessors compatible with those for 'flowSet'
getFileName             get the cdf file name associated with
                        ncdfFlowSet object
getIndices,ncdfFlowSet,character-method
                        'getIndices' extracts the event indices of one
                        or multiple samples from ncdfFlowSet
lapply,ncdfFlowList-method
                        lapply method for ncdfFlowList
ncdfFlow                ncdfFlow: A package that provides CDF storage
                        based flow cytometry data analysis.
ncdfFlowList-class      a class that stores multiple ncdfFlowSet
                        objects
ncdfFlowSet,flowSet-method
                        create ncdfFlowSet from flowSet
ncdfFlowSet-class       a class for storing flow cytometry raw data in
                        HDF5 format
ncfsApply,ncdfFlowSet-method
                        apply method for ncdfFlowSet (for internal use)
rbind2,ncdfFlowList,ANY-method
                        combine multiple ncdfFlowSet objects into one
read.ncdfFlowSet        create ncdfFlowSet from FCS files
replacement method for ncdfFlowSet
                        write the flow data from a 'flowFrame' to
                        'ncdfFlowSet' flowFrame can have less channels
                        than ncdfFlowSet,which is used for partial
                        updating(useful for 'normalization')
save_ncfs               save/load a ncdfFlowSet object to/from disk.
split,ncdfFlowList,factor-method
                        split a 'ncdfFlowSet' object.
subset.ncdfFlowSet      subset the ncdfFlowSet/ncdfFlowList based on
                        'pData'
unlink,ncdfFlowSet-method
                        delete the cdf file associated with the
                        ncdfFlowSet object ncdfFlowSet object is
                        unrecoverable after cdf is deleted. So this
                        method is usually called when ncdfFlowSet
                        object is no longer in need.
