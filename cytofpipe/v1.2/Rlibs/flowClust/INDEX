flowClust2Prior         Generate a prior specification based on a
                        flowClust model This function generates a prior
                        specification based on a flowClust fit object
                        It can be passed to a second round of
                        flowClust() with usePrior="yes" The prior could
                        be estimated from a single sample, for example,
                        and then used to speed up the convergence for
                        other samples.
