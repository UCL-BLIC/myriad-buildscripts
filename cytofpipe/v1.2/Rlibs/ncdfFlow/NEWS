1.1.1

FEATURES:
	-netCDF support for large data sets.
	-centralized storage of flow data in 3-D matrix (sample*channel*event)
	-fast data accessing,subsetting and splitting 
	-support all the related methods for flowSet
	 
KNOWN ISSUES:
	
	write meta data - ncdfFlow allows user to save the entire ncdfFlowSet object in ncdf file.
	Currently the meta data is first serialized in R and stored as raw vector in cdf. It can fail 
	when the meta data size exceeds the limit of serialization function.  
	 
CHANGES IN 1.1.2:

	1.Using temporary directory instead of working directory to store cdf file in creating ncdfFlowSet from flowSet 
	2.allow for user specified path in ncdfFlowSet_sync method to save the cdf in different location other than original one
	3.clone.ncdfFlowSet function:
		-change argument name to avoid confusion:sNewNcFile-->isNew ;newNcFile-->fileName 
		-avoid copying the entire cdf repository when clone subsetted ncdfFlowSet
		-fix the bug of inconsistent dimensions (sample*colnames) when create the new cdf file
	4.check whether source file exist in read.ncdfFlowSet
	5..writeSlice:
		-allow for either flowFrame or matrix to be added by
		-add sample name to the error message to help troubleshoot the problematic FCS file especially for loading large datasets
	6.add isNew=FALSE to split method to allow for splitting into multipe cdf files for the sake of parallel computing
	7.set compress=FALSE to disable compression mode of CDF
	
CHANGES IN 1.3.2
	1.optimize [[ accessor by merging two routines into [[ method and removing some unnecessary check or subsetting

CHANGES IN 1.5.32
	1.add "file" argument to allow user to specify file path
	2.add "rbind" method to allow combining more than two ncdfFlowSets once,

CHANGES IN 2.11.39
Enhancement
+ update 'samples' slot of 'ncdfFlowList' class from 'character' to 'named integer' to speed up look up
+ replace 'coerce' method with 'ncdfFlowList' constructor function
+ update validity check of 'ncdfFlowList' class
+ add 'subset.ncdfFlowList' and 'subset.ncdfFlowSet' S3 functions to subset the ncdfFlowSet/ncdfFlowList based on 'pData'
+ wrap "[[" logic into c++ to speed it up
+ add 'save_ncfs' and 'load_ncfs' functions to save/load a ncdfFlowSet object to/from disk.
